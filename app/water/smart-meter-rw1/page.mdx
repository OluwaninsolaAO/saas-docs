## 2. Important Safety Information

### 2.1 Safe Use of the Meter

- **Professional Installation:** Your Rokswood Group meter should only be installed and serviced by qualified personnel. Do not attempt to open or modify the meter yourself.
- **Environmental Conditions:** Ensure the meter is installed in a location that meets the recommended environmental specifications (temperature, humidity). Avoid exposing the meter to direct sunlight, extreme heat, or excessive moisture.

### 2.2 Ensuring Equipment Safety

- **Cable Integrity:** Periodically inspect any visible cables connected to the meter for signs of wear or damage. If any damage is observed, contact Rokswood Group support.

## 3. Getting Started

### 3.1 Meter Overview

- **Indicator Lights:** Occationally, the meter indicator light flashes red and green, this happens during the meter's wake cycle.

### 3.2 Understanding Your Readings

Your meter provides real-time data on your consumption.

- **Ltr:** Your meter measures water in Ltr.
- **Current Reading:** This shows your total accumulated consumption and can be viewed in the Rokswood Utility Mobile App.
- **Credit Balance:** For prepaid meters, this displays your remaining credit and can be viewed in the Rokswood Utility Mobile App.

## 4. Recharging Your Meter

Keeping your meter topped up is essential for uninterrupted service. Rokswood Group meters primarily support two recharging methods: remote connectivity and token-based.

### 4.1 Remote Recharge (Most Common)

Most Rokswood Group meters are designed for convenient remote recharging. Once you have purchased credit through our authorized channels (e.g., mobile app, web portal), your meter will automatically update its credit balance via its network connection.

- **How it Works:** After a successful purchase, the credit is sent directly to your meter over the air.
- **Confirmation:** You'll typically receive an SMS or in-app notification confirming the successful recharge.
- **Automatic Update:** Your meter's credit balance should update in the mobile app within a few minutes to reflect the new credit balance.

## 5. Important Note for Battery-Powered Meters and Sleep Cycles

Some Rokswood Group meters are battery-powered to ensure long-term operation without external power. To conserve battery life, these meters are designed to report usage and update their status at set intervals (e.g., every 6 hours, once a day). This is referred to as their **sleep cycle**.

### 5.1 Triggering Meter Wake-Up

If you recharge your battery-powered meter **during its sleep cycle**, the meter will not immediately update its credit balance from the remote server. To ensure your meter reflects the new credit promptly, you need to **manually trigger the meter to wake up**.

- **How to Trigger Wake-Up:**

  - Press and hold the soft touch trigger on the meter for 5 seconds until when the red indicator light lit up then release and then immediately after release, tap the soft touch trigger once to wake up the meter.

- **Confirmation:** Once triggered, the meter will connect to the server, update its status, and display the new credit balance in the app. This process usually takes a few seconds.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues
